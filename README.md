# Welcome to the world of creativity and functionality!

I am an enthusiastic beginner programmer who is passionate about creating user-friendly applications.
Although I am still learning and growing, my portfolio already includes:
- **PyQt Calculator:** Perform basic arithmetic operations, maintain a history of your calculations, and save results for later use – all within the user-friendly PyQt Calculator.
- **Quadratic Equation Solver:** Say goodbye to complex calculations! Enter coefficients and see the equation, roots, and graph – all in one place.
- **Interactive Shape Exploration:** Dive into the world of 2D and 3D shapes (still under development!).
- **Python Turtle Playground:** Unleash your artistic side and code stunning drawings.
- **BMI Calculator:** Maintain your health goals with this sleek and user-friendly app.
- **Party Guest List App:** Plan your perfect party! This application provides a simple interface with powerful features to add, edit, and delete guests from your event's guest list.

I am open to learning new things and constantly striving to improve my skills.
Check out my applications, explore the code, and share your ideas!
